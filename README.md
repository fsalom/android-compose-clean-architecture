# Android Clean Architecture with Kotlin and Compose

## Description
Welcome to the repository for Android Clean Architecture with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose! This project serves as a comprehensive guide and practical implementation of Clean Architecture principles in Android app development using the powerful combination of Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## Overview
Clean Architecture, introduced by Robert C. Martin, emphasizes the separation of concerns and the independence of the business logic from the frameworks and tools. In this repository, we explore how to implement Clean Architecture on the Android platform, taking advantage of Kotlin's expressiveness and Jetpack Compose's modern UI toolkit.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
´´´
git clone https://github.com/fsalom/android-compose-clean-architecture.git
´´´

Open the project in Android Studio.

Explore the various branches representing different stages of the implementation.

## Features
This repository demonstrates practical examples of the following key components:

- Domain Layer: Contains the business logic, entities, and use cases independent of the framework.

- Data Layer: Manages the data sources and implements repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.

- Presentation Layer: Utilizes Jetpack Compose for building the user interface and interacts with the domain layer through view models.

## Examples
Take a look at the examples provided in the repository to understand how Clean Architecture principles are applied in a real-world Android app. Examples include:

Use Case Implementation:

See how use cases are implemented in the domain layer, encapsulating business logic.
Repository Pattern:

Explore the data layer to understand how the repository pattern is employed to fetch and store data.
Jetpack Compose UI:

Dive into Jetpack Compose code in the presentation layer to create a modern and responsive user interface.
